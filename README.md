# RPM Model

Version: 0.0.1

A set of models that the RPM framework uses to think about 3D reality.

The file `model/package-json.go` represents the format that is stored in the central repository and used for creating facets for filtering and finding components.

An autogenerated JS version is created in the `model-js/` folder and published to npm

See the `model/examples` for how this format fits together.
